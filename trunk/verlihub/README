Troubleshooting:
----------------

Can't connect to mysql..

this is a frequent problem. It's usually that verlihub
doesn't find it's correct configuration folder which should be placed
in the location where you are running hub from. For egsample in your
home directory (in this cas you would probaly to make sure you are there
use a sequence  "cd ~ && verlihub" ; note that file ~/.verlihub/dbconfig
contains correct settings).
