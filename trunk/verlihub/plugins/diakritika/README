Hi,

this plugin processes each chet message, and replaces given characters by other given characters. A littble bit like 'tr' command.

Settings:
---------

verlihub's SetupList table is used. You need to add two variables in it.. if you wanna se only lower case chars in chat then do this in mysql..

INSERT INTO SetupList VALUES ('pi_diakritika','replace_from','ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ');
INSERT INTO SetupList VALUES ('pi_diakritika','replace_to'  ,'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz');

then corresponding to the order in the given string lest's say the 'I' will be transofrmed into 'i' ...
got it?

enjoy.

Note, You might have problems with the encoding of characters if you are using myadmin...
These settings are read from database only on reloding of plugin, see command !plugreload
