INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR Win Version of VERLIHUB
----------------------------------------------

What you need?
--------------
* Win32
* verlihub.exe
* mysql server and client with libs, etc...
* some libraries (pcre.dll, geoip.dll, maybe more...)
---- optinal:
* Apache2 +PHP

Where you get it?
-----------------
* Win32 : that's your windows, if you don't have one, rather user verlihub for linux, compile it, and be happy :)
* verlihub.exe : after it's released, you can dl it from http://sf.net/projects/verlihub (in section files, probably .zip)
* mysql : go to http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html , searh for string "Windows downloads
* mysql also you can read this http://www.devside.net/web/server/win32/mysql-bin
", choose the one you like (installer or not), dl it, install it..
* libraries : if some are needed, I'll probably include them into the .zip file
* Apache : http://apache.crihan.fr/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/apache_2.0.48-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi

Important Security:
-------------------
* mysql .. be sure to setup admin password for mysql and/or close mysql port on firewall

Configuration:
--------------
* hate to say it, but there is no script that does it for you, so you would have to proceed










Compiling it: (you DON'T PROBABLY NEED THIS)
--------------------------------------------
* http://synesis.com.au/software/#unixem
* http://www.psyon.org/projects/pcre-win32/
* http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/c/
* geoip
* Makefile.win and mingw32, ideally Dev-Cpp
* also note that linking libmysqlclient makes problems, you need to reimp the library, description can be found somewhere on mysql page, also ther e is a link somewhere in the code ;o)
* good luck

preprocessor defined variables:
-------------------------------
_WIN32,WIN32,WITHOUT_GEOIP

Compiling troubleshooting:
--------------------------
* Cannot open include 'sys/time.h' : ....
>>> add include path for unixem/include
* Cannot open include 'mysql.h' : ....
>>> add include path for where you have mysql/include
* same for pcre.h, GeoIP.h
'dynamic_cast' used on polymorphic type ....
>>> project options/ C C++ / C++ language Enable Run-time Type Info
Linking Troubleshooting:
------------------------
* error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__inet_ntoa@4
>>> ws2_32.lib library needed
* error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _mysql_close@4
>>> add library path for mysql/lib/opt and add libmysql.lib library
* error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _pcre_compile
>>> add lib path to pcre, and add pcre.lib
* error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _dlerror
>>> add path for unixem lib, and add unixem.lib
* error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GeoIP_new
>>> remove the cgeoip.cpp from project and add compiler prepocessor definition WITHOUT_GEOIP
*
