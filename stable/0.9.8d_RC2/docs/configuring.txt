Configuration directory:
-----------------------
that is a folder in which verlihub is looking for configuration files.
by default it's /etc/verlihub
it may be also one of following depending on existence
$HOME/.verlihub
./.verlihub
$VERLIHUB_CFG

these paths are in the order in which they override each other. The latest will be used if specified and exists..

Database access:
---------------
The first thing you need to ensure working is the database access. Since every hub's runtime important information is saved there (Registered user , Ops, etc, Bans, Kicks, and more...). Your mysql server may run wherever you wan enev on another machine somewhere over internet, but be concuios of the slowdown effect it may have on kicks, and logins ... Otherwise I tested to run verlihub with db accross the world, and once there were all users and when no kicks happened everything was normal-like. So it's possible, but I recomment you to use database server on the same machine or maybe it's even better to use one in the LAN somewhere around the hub machine. Both is quick and fine..

To ensure this variety of possibilities, one has to confirue it properly in the dbconfig file, which usually would be in the $VERLIHUB_CFG/dbconfig that is in your home dir ( see section running). In this file there are and you may add many variable, most of them have default values compiled in the hub, but at least these for mysql have to be overriden.

They are the following:
db_host - specifiesthe IP or hostname of the mysql server (localhost) is default..
db_data - specifies the name of existing database in which verlihub creates it's tables and stores the data ... but it's up to you to ENSURE that the database exists and that you have full access to it
db_user - username to acces that database
db_pass - user's password

So if you ensure existancea nd full access to some database, and fill these variables in, that should be ok.

Listen Port:
------------

* You can specify listen port directly from the command line e.g: verlihub 411
* Otherwise the number stored in database table SetupList  ('config','listen_port')

It is important that you setup also variable: listen_port in the config file of the database table SetupList, because without a correct listening port hub can't start. Usually it's 411 but that can't work specially when you want to start hub ans non-root user... So make this clear before starting.

* Multiple listen ports : you can setup a variable extra_listen_ports to a space separated list of numbers of ports to listen at in addition to the listen_port
e.g: 4111 1411
 - all ports are then treated the same way

Creating tables:
---------------
Once you setup database access and listen port, just run verlihub and stop it for example by command "killall verlihub" (or verlihub.C, whatever the verlihub name was), or if you just run it like ./verlihub or something, press ctrl+c ... Empty but ready tables should be prepared in the database. If they aren't that means that there is some problem and you should have a look into the log for what is it. It would most probably be one of either listening port of bad db_.... variables. Than can be of caourse caused because of default values have been used. That may happen if you don't run verlihub as you should...(see section Running verlihub" Otherwise your tables are ready..



Registering users, ops and stuff..
----------------------------------

As I mentioned in previous section (Database access), all these are in database. You  need to register one MASTER by some special means and then you can do rest on DC.. I'll explain, how you can do it to create administrator. In fact it's already explained in the file verlihub.html... I won't rewrite it again. Maybe later...

So you have read it and probable have created also the admin user in your database. Fine, what's next??

Running verlihub
----------------

There is the runhub script that makes some verifications and also launches verlihub like a "daemon" in fact it runs it normally in a background (with &) and then disowns it from current shell. Also redirects normal and error output to given files.. Usually those are in .verlihub/log and .verlihub/err. You would look for stuf there in case of some basic problem. 

The runhub script (which is located in the scripts directory of the project and feel free to copy it for example to your $HOME) is of course working in some cases, when it knows where to find verlihub executable. If it can't you can modify it and specify the path byt the variable exepath.

Stopping verlihub
-----------------

From the shell you can do "killall verlihub" , you can also use the runhub script "./runhub -s" or if you already have admin rights on the hub (in DC) type !quit command in the main chat.


Setting up basic stuff
----------------------

Lot's of basic settings can be made in the databse, table SetupList where `file`='config'. For the wellcome message there is another file .verlihub/motd . This one is taken as you write it and sent to every users who logs in to hub. Be careful how to do it. Don't put there any pipes '|', you can avoid them. Also there sometimes is problem with windows versus linux conding of new lines in text files. They differ. The easiest way would be to edit motd file in windows and ftp it in !!!!BINARY!!! mode to the linux server. Otherwise you can use other methods, like program unix2dos if you have it, and many more..

A simple example of .verlihub directory is what is called scripts/def_config
you can do 
cp scripts/def_config $HOME/.verlihub -R
to use this one and then modify it as you wish. You can add or remove config variables from it... Unknown are ignored. Unspecified obtain default values... Every variable should be on one line and equal sign is surronded by spaces from each side (one or more). e.g.
hub_name = The SuprDupr Hub ;o)
# comments may start with # .. rather put them only on empty lines like this
max_users = 7000 # not like this, if it may probably work out.. not sure with strings

So that's motd, hub_name and max_users.

Language settings
-----------------

some texts of verlihub can be translated, specialy those that hub sends to users.

by default, you will not see them in the database

how to translate?

1/ != save_lang 1
2/ restart hub
3/ != save_lang 0 you will not need it anymore..
4/ now you have in SetupList some variables with their english values, whatever you change there it will be loaded next time, read on....

5/ you can keep the lang_en and make a copy to lang_whatever, to make verlihub load the correct language, add into the.verlihub/dbconfig a line with 

	lang_name = lang_whatever


6/ maybe one day, verlihub will be able to load more language settings at a time and treat users with their languages ;o) lol, don't dream too much 



Special cases
-------------

* registered only hub :  max_users = 0 and max_extra_regs = 7000
* nationalistic hub : cc_zone1 = :AA:BB:CC:DD: (countries that you prefer), max_users = 7000 max_users0 = 100 (foreign visitors) max_users1 = 6900
* extra other special limit for some countries:w
